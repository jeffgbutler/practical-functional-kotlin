# Practical Functional Kotlin
Examples and exercises for the "Practical Functional Kotlin" workshop.

See [https://jeffgbutler.github.io/practical-functional-kotlin/](https://jeffgbutler.github.io/practical-functional-kotlin/) for detailed instructions. 

## Exercises
For all exercises, the basic instructions are "make the tests pass". This may involve uncommenting some failing tests. There are TODO comments in most classes in the "exercises.*" packages with instructions on what to do. See the links above for detailed descriptions of the exercises.
